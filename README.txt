The program run_bin_adapt_crct.R compiles the simulations and saves the output for the adaptive design.
The program run_bin_crct.R compiles the simulations and saves the output for the nonadaptive design.

adapt_sim_convergence.R and adapt_sim_performance.R assess the convergence and performance measures of the 
simulations, respectively.

drop_cutpoints.R looks at adaptive design decisions using different cutpoints
